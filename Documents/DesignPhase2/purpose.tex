\section{Purpose of this document} 

This document describes the design of the Betelgeuze release of CloudMan. It is based on the experiences from the first implementation, code name Aldebaran, including new requirements and additional features which have been found to be required. 

The main goals of this release are:
\begin{itemize}
\item a complete review of the concepts and definitions
\item perform a complete code review 
\item add sample backends
\item add a feedback loop which allows to report the status of the projects
\item inclusion of storage
\end{itemize}

As a general guideline, standard OpenSource tools and frameworks, and/or existing services should be used where ever possible.
