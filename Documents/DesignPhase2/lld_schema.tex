The low level data export layer publishes the configuration data entered in the front end, so that it can be consumed by the different backends.
The data and the format should be customizable for each backend. 
This can be done for example by exploiting features of Django.  

In the second phase of the project, the same mechanism shall be used by the backends to provide live monitoring information about their current status.
