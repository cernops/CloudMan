%The OpenNebula backend is meant mainly as a playground until an OpenStack testbed is available. 
With the availability of an OpenStack testbed the priority of developing a backend for OpenNebula has dropped for CERN. The OpenNebula based infrastructure at CERN is planned to be retired at end 2012 or early 2013, and absorbed in the new OpenStack based infrastructure. Therefore the priority is moved to OpenStack.
