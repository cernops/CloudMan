Static configuration data can be stored in configuration files on the 
server(s) but should be avoided, in order to keep the service stateless. 
Instead, such configuration data should be entered in the GUI and 
stored in the database. 

In case such a file is needed anyway, the format must be plain text, 
so that it can be easily manipulated by configuration components
 eg from Quattor (or Puppet). The development of such 
components is NOT part of this project. The format must be key-value pairs, 
following the python config parser format {\it FIXME: add reference}
