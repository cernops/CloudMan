Resource pools in CloudMan only have high level meta data information, like
\begin{itemize}
\item identifier (eg like landb cluster name)
\item description
\item size 
\item type
\item features 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item public or not
 \item support for life migration or not
 \item reliable or not, critical power etc 
 \item GPN/LCG network
 \item {\it what else }
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
There are mandatory and optional fields. 
It must be easy to add additional fields without having to 
change the application.
