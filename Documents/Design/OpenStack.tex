The planned OpenStack backend can be derived from the OpenNebula backend. Projects will be mapped to tendants. 
As in the OpenNebula case, the backend will create a new tenant for each leaf in the tree defined in CloudMan.

Thus, the OpenStack backend relies on the possibility to set quotas per tenant.
