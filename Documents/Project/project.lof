They authenticate using the site Single Sign On mechanism or similar. The data which is entered is stored in an external database, and exported in a low level format. Back-ends which are design to configure specific services, for example local cloud installations, consume this information to configure their resources.}}{4}

Ideally, this is a single individual, eventually complemented by a backup. Normal users can be any registered user, which can be many thousands.}}{7}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces Hirarchies within VOs: Each VO has one or more VO manager who approves the different projects within the VO, nominates project managers and so forth. The project managers, in turn, can manage different sub-projects which belong to the project they manage. Users don't have special rights. They are part of a sub-project in which they work. }}{8}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces Relationship between roles and resource pools. The resource manager has an abstract high level view over available resource pools. He allocates fractions of these resource pools to VO managers who can in turn allocate bits of these resource pools to the different projects, and so forth. }}{9}
